        <p id="paragraph">Well, what's to say? I'm 33 years old, I just 
                got married last September, life is good. Just 
                repetitive... My life outside of work is great, 
                spontaneous, and exciting. That's why I decided 
                to go for a career change. I've seen it all and 
                done it all, as a bartender. I started in the food
                and beverage industry when I was 16 years old. I 
                started as a dishwasher, busboy, server, etc... 
                And, so on. And, so forth. After 17 years of doing 
                this and the wide experience of fine dining and 
                "THE RUSH" of casual dining. Nothing is unexpected 
                anymore. So, I got bored and picked up hobbies, to 
                unleash a more creative side of myself. While still 
                working full-time, I decided to do a little wood 
                working. It started off small, then it got bigger.
                Along with building my own workbench to the patio 
                furniture on my deck. What can I say? The feeling 
                you get when a plan goes into action and the end 
                result is even better than you thought it would 
                be. Unbelievable!!! You don't want to stop. You 
                want to go out and build a house, from the ground 
                up. The only, tiniest, minute, pocket-sized 
                problem with that is....   After, I got done with 
                those projects, I had nothing in my pockets to 
                afford new material, for the new projects. So, 
                looking for an alternative. I had a friend suggest 
                the tech frontier. So, I looked into it. We live in 
                the digital age, the age of computers and technology. 
                You want to know what I saw? I saw a "free, limitless, 
                canvas of creativivty". HTML is my hammer and saw, CSS 
                is my endless lumber yard. Now, that I have started 
                this. I don't want it to end...</p>
